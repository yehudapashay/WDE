<h2 align="center"><u>About me</u></h2>
<br/>
<br/>
  <pre>
My name is Ruvik Danilovich and I was born on January 24, 1971.
I am a Israeli politician.In 2008, I was elected mayor of Beersheba, after serving as deputy mayor under Yaakov Turner.
I was reelected in 2013 with 92.21% of the ballots.
</pre>
<h5 align="center"><u>My political career</u></h5>

  <pre>
Danilovich's 2009 election victory over Turner was described as an "Oedipal story."
Turner often referred to Danilovich as his designated successor.
At a Purim parade several years prior to the election, Danilovich dressed up as a pilot,
an obvious hint that he planned to succeed Turner, who was director of the nearby Israel Air Force Museum.
Danilovich won 60% of the vote. During the campaign, bogus death notices announcing Turner's supposed demise were put up on walls throughout the Negev city.
Shortly after his election, Danilovich was forced to contend with Grad missiles falling on his city during Operation Cast Lead. 
Following the operation, Danilovich presented a ten-year plan (2010–2020) for his city to transform it into an important metropolitan area in Israel. 
The plan includes improvements to education, infrastructure, job opportunities.
In the Municipal elections that were held in Israel on October 30, Danilovich continues for a third term with 91.97 percent (68,400) of the vote. 
His party, "Derech Hadasha," increased its power in the city council and won 16 of the 27 seats available, compared to the 14 seats it won in the previous election.

1.
Introduction:

Web 1.0 is simply an information portal where users passively receive information without being given the opportunity to post reviews, comments, and feedback.
Web 2.0 encourages participation, collaboration, and information
sharing. Examples of Web 2.0 applications are Youtube, Wiki, Flickr, Facebook,
and so on.
Web 3.0 is a semantic web which refers to the future. 
In Web 3.0, computers can interpret information like humans and intelligently generate and distribute useful content tailored to the needs of users. 
One example of Web 3.0 is Tivo, a digital video recorder. Its recording program can search the web and read what it finds to you based on your preferences.

The main difference between web 1.0, web 2.0 and web 3.0 is that web 1.0 is consider as read-only web targets on
content creativity of producer web 2.0 targets on content creativity of users and producers while web 3.0 targets on
linked data sets.

Difference between Web 1.0, Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 :
A.Information retrieval:
	-In Web 1.0 search engines retrieve macro contents.Search is very fast butmany times results areinaccurate or more thanusers can "chew".
	-In Web 2.0 search engines retrieve tags with micro contents(Furl even retrieves tags with macro contents). 
	The process of tagging is manual, tedious and covers negligible percents of the WWW. 
	Web 2.0 tags everything: pictures, links, events,news, Blogs, audio, video, and so on. Google Base even retrieves micro content texts
	-In Web 3.0 search engines will hopefully retrieve micro content texts which were tagged automatically. 
	This implies translating billions of Web 1.0 macro contents into micro contents. 
	The result could be more precise search because tagging can solve part of the ambiguity that homonyms and synonyms introduce into the process of Search.

B.General idea:	
	-Web 1.0 was all about static content, one way publishing of content without any real interaction between readers or publishers or each other.
	-Web 2.0 is more about 2 way communication through social networking, blogging, wikis,tagging, user generated content and video.
	-Web 3.0 is curiusly undefined.AI and the web learning what you want and delivering you a Personalized web experience
	
C.Features:
	Web 1.0-Hyper linking and bookmarking on pages.No communication between server and user.Websites were Static.It allowed only browsing of content.
	Web 2.0-Better interaction.Includes functions like Video streaming, Online documents, etc.Introduction of web applications.Everything becomes online and stores on servers.
	Web 3.0-Smart, web based applications and functionalities.An amalgamation of Web technology and Knowledge Representation (KR).
	
	
2.We will demonstrate the differences with use-case:

	-Let's say we run the query "GM GM crop"
	It can be said that in Web 1.0 the result of the query will be identical to all users.
	However, in Web 3.0 when your search query GM crop will not lead you to GM (General Motors) website. Why? 
	Cause, first by synonym identification Google will understand that GM may mean General Motors or Genetically Modified. 
	Then by context i.e. by the keyword crop it will deduce that the user wants information on genetically modified crops and not on General Motors. 
	Similarly, GM car will not lead you to genetically modified crop.
